# Basic Navigation Experience

This example demostrates every type of scene available through iVX. Starting with a navigation menu, the user is able to explore these scenes and edit the content of the content in this example.

# How to run it

    1) Open the terminal
    2) Run the CLI command - "npm run example:basic-navigation-experience"
        -> Your default browser will automatically open the example in a new tab with the URL: localhost:8080/# 

# How to edit/use it

Once localhost:8080 has opened in a new tab, you will be directed to a basic navigation menu.  The labels for each of the visible links can be edited by navigating to *basic-navigation-experience/config/default/states/basic-menu-scene*.  From there, navigate to the "links" folder and find the link you want to edit, to change the label within the "label.html" file.

If you want to edit the content displayed in each scene, you will need to select the associated page within the */config/default/states* folder.
